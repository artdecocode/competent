        Component properties.

      The same as render, but for the server only. Called by _Component_ using _NodeJS_ runtime and not by _Preact_ in browser, therefore _NodeJS_ API could be used here.
    </fn>
    <static name="load" void>
      <arg name="callback" type="function(Error, !Object=): void">
        A method called by browser-side bundle prior to rendering of a component with a callback, e.g., to load necessary assets. The callback should be called by the component when the loading is done, after which the component will render. The second argument to the callback can be a map of properties that should also be passed to the component.
